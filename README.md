# Zoo Simulator Task

This project simulates a zoo environment with the three animals: monkeys, giraffes, and elephants. The simulation supports health management, feeding, and passing time. This guide will help you set up the project locally on a Windows machine.

## Prerequisites

- Python

- pip

- pytest (for running tests)

## Setup Instructions

### Set Up a Virtual Environment

1. Create the Virtual Environment:

2. Activate the Virtual Environment:

3. Install Pytest

### Running the Project

1. Running the Application

2. Running the Tests

### Troubleshooting

- If tests are showing as errors then please re-run pytest. The main.py uses random integers so there can be issues passing test.

- If pytest is not recognised, ensure the virtual environment is activated.

- If you continue having issues with pytest then check the conftest.py file and configure it to suit your machine.

- If Python is not found, check that Python is added to your systemâ€™s PATH variable.
